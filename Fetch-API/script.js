// Fetch API

// The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for "XMLHttpRequest".

//  The global "fetch()" method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the response is available.

// The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.
